Bernard Chabot's Bio
==

Bernard Chabot is an expert in __knowledge engineering__ and __product lifecycle management__ (better known by its acronym PLM = "Product Lifecycle Management").

------
Trained as an agro-food engineer, for 10 years he led teams of technicians in the __research-development__ and __industrialization__ of agro-food products intended for mass distribution ...

------
During this period, he also worked on the adaptation of the __principles and methods of PLM approaches (initially designed for manufacturing) to the __industries of the formulation professions (food processing, cosmetics, chemistry, etc.) based essentially on the notion of __trade variant__.

------
For 15 years, he then carried out __ PLM__ missions (most of the time with a __"project management assistance" positioning) in a large number of companies, small or large, and belonging to a wide variety of industrial sectors (energy, automotive, manufacturing, food processing, cosmetics, textiles, ...).

------
During this same period he implemented __semantic web standards and technologies (RDF, RDFS, OWL, SPARQL, ...) on the different knowledge domains related to __"enterprise architecture"__ and/or __"IS urbanization" approaches in order to industrialize and accelerate the upstream phases of a PLM project.

------
Currently an independent consultant, Bernard Chabot, is working mainly on an offer to specify formal business models that are "testable", "explainable" and "executable" (based on OWL ontologies and SWRL rules).Â 

------
This #XAI (= "eXplainable Artificial Intelligence") type offer, although primarily intended for industrialists wishing to apply knowledge engineering methods and tools to the PLM field, is highly generic in nature, allowing it to be used in many fields.
